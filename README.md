# C++ in C
## Three examples of how to use C++ code from C:

1. The simplest example: `Simplest Possible Example`
2. A minimal example using a dynamically linked C++ library with a C++ class: `Dynamic Linking OOP Example`.
3. An example showing how this all can be used to enable C to use PyTorch: `LibTorch Example`

The Makefiles are commented with some explanation and more info on this topic can be found
